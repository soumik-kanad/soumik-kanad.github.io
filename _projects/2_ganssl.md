- Comments: I think the answer to the title is "no" in case of StyleGAN2. Preliminary results were intersting but later results weren't as good. 
- [This ICCV23 paper](https://seva100.github.io/stylegan-for-facerec) uses the same idea for face recognition. Our results were also decent for face image classification but we didn't move ahead with this because it doesn't work very well for other domains like birds and cars.
