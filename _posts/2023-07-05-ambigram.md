# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).

# toc:
#   - name: Equations
#     # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
#     # subsections:
#     #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
#     #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
#   - name: Citations
#   - name: Footnotes

Ambigrams are text/pictures which when rotated by 180 degrees, still represent something meaningful. If you have read ‘Angels and Demons’ by Dan Brown you already know about it. I had created these because the online generators failed for my first name.

I realised that there aren't any good places to put this on this website template without overcrowding it. So, I'm including them as a post.


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ambigram.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/ambigram-white.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
