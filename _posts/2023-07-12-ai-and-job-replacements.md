## Blue collar vs white collar

In a simplified classification of jobs, one could categorise them into three classes - physical labour jobs, mental labour jobs, and creative jobs. There could be other categories or jobs that might not fit these categories but I think these are quite prevalent. Physical labour jobs include jobs like all the construction jobs, plumbing, electical jobs, and other physical maintenance jobs while mental labour jobs include other administrative desk jobs which do need a skill set at time but may not need creativity as such like clerical jobs, annotaters, programmers, customer service, etc. Finally, creative jobs include jobs like music, art, research, etc. where something nes is being created. 

Scientists in the previous century thought that if we were successful in creating artificial intelligence (AI), it would take jobs in the same order of categories as I list them above[^1]. But as we move closer to the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it seems that the opposite order may be more probable. Today we see that just with prompts one can create beautiful art, music, poetry but we are far away from perfectly working autonomous cars or other forms of robotics. One interesting analogy to see why that may be the case lies in evolution of human intelligence vs animal locomotion. It is noteworthy to see that human intelligence evolved only recently, for example humans started tool use only 3.5 million years (Pliocene epoch [^2]) ago. On the other hand locomotion in animals date back to at least 560 million years [^3]. This shows how much evolution was required to perfect (or rather just making functional) our physical movement (with which also comes planning) while only a fraction of that time was invested in evolving human intelligence. 

This may not be a perfect evidence but does **points towards the possibility of creativity being an easier problem to solve than physical labour**. Even though this is not a proof of any sorts but it is a powerful idea and worth thinking about. Another reason that might have caused creatively intelligent tasks being solved before more physically skilled task maybe because of the abundance of data in the former due to internet compared to the later. But these are all speculations and only time will tell which was the actual reason.


### Acknowledgements
I don't think this is my original thought. I definitely came across this in come video that had an Youtuber called [Varun Mayya](https://www.youtube.com/@VarunMayya). I tried finding it but could find it given the abundance of these short form videos these days.
